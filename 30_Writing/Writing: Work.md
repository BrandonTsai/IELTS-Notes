``Work-life balance``
----------------------

## Band 9 IELTS Essay Sample

When we study the **biographies** of highly successful people one thing that **strikes** us is the fact that they **devoted** their entire life to their **cause**. They cared for nothing else. It was this single **minded** **devotion** that helped them leave a mark behind. However, this does not mean that work-life balance is not required. ***Neither does it mean that*** just because someone spends their entire life in the workplace, they will be as famous or successful as Mohandas Gandhi, Albert Einstein or Steve Jobs.

People like Gandhi or Martin Luther King had just one **mission** in their life. They believed in a cause and were ready to **lay their life down** for that cause. ***Consequently***, they did not care about work-life balance. Actually, their work was their life. This is not the case with the average Joe. **The vast majority of people** work with the **sole** **objective** of making a living. They are not exactly concerned about leaving **indelible** **footprints behind**. They only want a secure source of income. Work-life balance is important for them. In fact, if they donâ€™t get **adequate** leisure time and family time, they will **wilt** under the work pressure.

Another thing to consider is **job satisfaction**. Many people do not like their jobs; yet they go to work every day because they want to put food on the table. They want to send their children to school and pay bills. They want a home and perhaps they also want a car. Actually, the only reason for them to work is to earn money to lead a comfortable life. And comfort can only come from having adequate time for oneself and all the other things that one enjoys.

In conclusion, the truly motivated are the ones who actually make a difference to the world and for them work and life are one and the same. **Consequently**, they do not seek any further work-life balance; however, **the vast majority of** employees do not belong to that category of people. They work with the sole objective of earning money so that they can enjoy life. Work-life balance is absolutely essential for them.
