- construction, development
- tourist, traveller -> tourism

====
The two maps show the same island and while the first one is before
, the second one is after the construction for tourism.

*Looking first at* the map before construction,
we can see the approximate length of this island is 200 meters and there are no man-made landscapes and architectures on the island.

*Moving to the second* map, we can see there are two accommodation areas.
On is in the west near the beach while another one is in the centre of the island.
Between them, there is a restaurant in the north and a central reception block which is surrounded by a vehicle track. 
The track also goes down to the pier where people can go sailing in the south sea.
Tourists can swim near the beach which is located in the west of the island.
A footpath connecting the western accommodation units also leads to the beach.

Overall, comparing the two maps, there are significant changes after development.
Not only lots of facilities are built, but also the sea is used for activities.
The island has become a good place for travel.
