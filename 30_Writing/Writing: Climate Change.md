Climate change - Global warming
-------------------

Causes:
- Greenhouse gasses – CO2 emissions 
	- Increase the depletion of the ozone layer
- Deforestation

Problems/Consequences
- sea levels are rising due to Ice caps are melting
	- more dangerous hurricanes and typhoons
	- devastating effects on coastal habitats
- Nature Disaster are becoming more common and intensity.
	- bushfire

Solution
- renewable/sustainable energy
	- to install solar batteries on the roofs of buildings 
	- to build wind farms
- stop cutting down trees.
	- stop using Palm Oil
	- go paperless at home and in the office.


Air Pollution
------------------

Causes
- the emission of carbon dioxide (CO₂) into the atmosphere
	- The burning of fossil fuels
- the emission of sulphur dioxide (SO₂) from factories

Problems/Consequences
- greenhouse gases are the leading cause of climate change.
- acid rain:
	- health problems such as cough, asthma, and eye irritation.
	- toxic metals dissolved in water are absorbed by fruits, vegetables and animal tissues.
		- they have serious consequences on humans when consumed. 
		- For example, brain dysfunction in children, and nervous system diseases and even death can occur.
		
Solutions:
- Use enewable/sustainable energy source
	- to install solar batteries on the roofs of buildings 
	- to build wind farms
- Reduce the carbon footprint of a factory
- Planting more trees as trees absorb carbon dioxide.
