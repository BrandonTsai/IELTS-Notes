Notes
=======

Accommodation:
- Tiny <--> Spacious

Funiture:
- My parents give me a `antique vase` as the gift on the `housewarming party`
- The craftsman made a `carpet` with zebra print and the fabric has a very `soft texture`.
- Future buy: It is widely believed that `tumble dryer`, `robotic vacuum cleaner` and `dish washer` can help people save marriage from divorce


Home Decoration:
- Previous: `warm tone` -> `floral curtain`
- Redecorate
  - Light curtains **brighten up** a wall and a light ceiling can brighten up an entire room
  - Paint the wall with light and **neutral** colors.
- Renovate - `unfit for human habitation`

Decoration Style:
- `Minimalism`: Minimalism is all about living with less. **minimalists** usually **get rid of excess stuff** and living life based on experiences rather than worldly possessions
- Modern: Furniture pieces were no longer made exclusively out of wood. Steel, molded plywood, plastic, and other materials were introduced
- Traditional: dark woods, `elegant wallpaper`, `patterned rugs` and `intricate detail`.
