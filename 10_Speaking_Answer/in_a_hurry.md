well, speaking of an occasion when I do something in a hurry, the memory when I attended my friend, Elva's wedding comes into my mind. It was on July 3rd that Elva held her wedding with one of our mutual good friend Tom, actually, we've been knowing each other for more than 20 years since we've been neighbors since we were children. As I have been living and working here in Chongqing for more than 8 years, I asked for a 3 day's leave in order to get back to my hometown to attend their wedding, sharing my best wishes for the new couple. However, on my way to the airport the day before their wedding ,let me see, it's July 2nd, I made a huge mistake, which hardly made me miss the flight. My flight was 19pm and I set off from my home in CQ at 15 pm. I thought I had already picked up all my packages previously. What's more, I rechecked my handbags to insure that I had taken my ID card with me. Having thought that I had taken all the necessities with me. I headed for the airport. It was about an hour and a half's way to the airport, when I got into the taxi, almost half the journey already, I found that I cannot find my telephone. I was like,fully shocked, but I had no choice but to head back home and bring my phone with. I cannot deny that nowadays I could not live without my phone in hand. It was really an accident that I forgot to take it. As you know, I returned back only to find that the phone was right on the desk where I put my handbags. The second time I took a taxi and I was worrying about the flight all the way, what's fortunate, I went to get the boarding check in time. It was an unforgettable experience because I am always a well-organized girl, who is always making plans orderly for everything I do. The experience taught me a lesson. Never do something in a hurry, do preparations more carefully! AND do remember to check all the trifling matters you think are definite.
