=======

> Describe a job that you consider highly important
> You should say:
>
> - what the job is
> - what the job involves
> - why it is important
> and explain if people who do this job are appreciated enough by society

**I must admit that** I have realized one of my **passions** a little bit too late in life. Seems like I have always wanted to become a chef in a nice **high-end restaurant**. Eating food is great, isn’t it? But the process of cooking food and the skill it requires to have is what I find even more intriguing and fascinating.

I could probably enjoy working and being trained in fine dining restaurants or some cruise ships that offer a variety of international dishes. I would like to get to know different cultures all over the world through food. I think it is one of the aspects that distinguishes countries.

To be able to be a chef, I need to have education in culinary arts. I also need to undergo a training in various restaurants to be able to apply the knowledge and information I obtained at school. A chef is a highly creative person, since one of his/her responsibilities is to arrange food with a final touch and think of its overall appealing look on the plate.

The kitchen is the only place I have ever felt like I really belong to. I love its heat and the pressure, apparently.

Part 3
======

> Which jobs are the most respected in your country?

In my opinion, these are highly-skilled professional positions such as **in the fields of** law, medicine, and engineering. Usually, parents encourage their children to **undertake** such careers, because working in these domains, one always has a nice salary and **bright perspectives** in life. I specifically respect doctors, since they are not only hard-working professionals but also people who **dedicate** their lives to helping others.

> What changes in employment have there been in recent years in your country?

There has been a rejuvenation of the “**entrepreneurial spirit**” in our country: more and more people become involved in starting their own businesses. The “start-up” community is now more alive than ever, even college students launch their start-up businesses while studying. Even though there is a high failure rate of start-ups, people nevertheless are starting to **take the risk** and put their ideas into creation.

> Some people say it's better to work for yourself than be employed by a company. What's your view?

On the topic of self-employment, I agree with a Chinese **billionaire** Jack Ma. For young people, it is **wiser** to first seek a secue position at a smaller company, because at big ones recent graduates frequently get lost in the large system and **routine of endless repetitive tasks**, ending up unnoticed. At a **family-owned enterprise**, **on the contrary**, it is easier to seize opportunities and take initiatives. As one grows, it is important to focus on learning and developing hard skills. When there is a subjective border of learning reached, one might reconsider the career choice in favour of a more responsible place at a bigger corporation or even the difficult path of **entrepreneurship**.


> What jobs do you think are most valuable to society?

> What skills do you think are needed to get a good job these days?



> Do you think job satisfaction is more important than salary when choosing a job?

> Do you think women should be able to do all the same jobs that men do?
