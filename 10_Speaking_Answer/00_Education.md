Part 1
========


> Do you work or study?
I have been working as a programmer for the past 7 years. I *received/earned* a masters' degree in Taiwan when I was 25 years old. I really miss life as a student. If I could go back to that age, I would participate fully in the life of the school.

> What do you like about this subject?
the subject I studied is "Computer Science", To be honest, it is not an interesting subject for most people because you have to do a lot of math. But I am * rejoiced* with the process of solving problems. The most *enjoyable* part is that I can get a *deep sense of accomplishment* after fixing real-life issues with the skill I learned.

> Is your subject popular to study in your country?
This is a sure thing. I think "Information Technology" has become world-wide *favored* in modern society. That is because a lot of technologies used in our daily life are based on this subject, such as Google and Facebook. As a result, the graduate *in the field of software development* usually can get a higher income than others.

> If you had the chance, would you change the subject.
No,
Because:
- enjoyable
- solve logical problems make me feel a deep sense of accomplishment 
- most popular job in current society
But 
- hope to obtain in-depth knowledge of A.I.

> What did you like the most about your school?
Well, if you put me on the spot – if you’re talking about my primary school – the number one thing I liked were my teachers. I don’t know if it was just because I was a kid at the time but they were really warm and friendly – and it was some of my teachers back then – that inspired me to have a life-long passion for reading. I remember in particular one teacher – I can’t remember her name – it was Mrs. Riley or something – and she would always encourage me to read books, loan me books, talk about books with me. And that really got me into books at a time when I was really impressionable.
Do you stay in contact with old school friends?
Not really, I’ve got one best friend back in the States, but we don’t actually talk all that much anymore. He recently got married and we used to be best buds, we would hang out after school, we’d go get pizza together, we’d drive around together, we chatted about girls and about school and about out future – all that stuff – but since I’ve moved to Vietnam we’ve kind of grown apart and we’re not really as close as we used to be.

> What were your best subjects in school?
I didn’t have that many good subjects at all but I was really good in literature because I read a lot so it just came naturally to me. I was also good in history. I never studied but I listened in class and I had – like a – like a brilliant memory – almost like a photographic memory but not quite. And I could just remember dates and names and everything – simple! So I never had to study but I always got top marks in history. And besides that I was good in gym because I was very athletic but even if you’re not athletic it’s easy to get good marks when you’re in gym. I wasn’t good at math or the sciences or anything like that – things where you actually had to put in real work – I was bad at those things.

> What do most students in your country do after school?
It’s a big country so I can’t really answer for everyone but the school I used to go to – most kids would play sport after school. So girls usually played soccer and depending on the season guys would play basketball or soccer or hockey. If you weren’t doing that, there was like an after-school recreational community ‘club’ where a lot of outcasts in High School would go to play computer games or do art or something like that. Some kids would just head home – that’s what I did most of the time. I wanted to get home, play computer games – be alone. So I’d just head home if I wasn’t hanging out with a friend or something like that. I think there might have also been some after-school classes but they’re actually not that common in America. Most people when they finish school, they’re done with school and they’re moving on to do something fun after school.

> 
> -   When and where you started studying it
> -   What lessons were like

```

Part 3
=======

*wider skill set* that were not offered in the past. more *specific* major or courses as compared before. *involved* the use of modern technology such as computers that were not present in the past.

Past: *corporal punishment* was a popular approach to maintain the discipline of classroom.
Now: *detention*

No, computer can help to *spread knowledge*, 
but it can not help a child to develop personality 
wide variety of pupils

man: specialist of fashion, cooking

> What is the *difference between* the way children learn *and* the way adults learn?
child: through playing, visualize, *illustrate*, very easy to *lost attention*
adult: *well-educated*, advanced reading ability, easier to *concentrate on* reading, better *self-restraint*

> How well do you think schools *should* prepare young people for working life?
Some people think most import schools spread *general knowledge* and develop the personality, other think should teach the working skill.
remain debates

in many fields, Robot replaces human, job disappear.
Basic ability and attitude, ... prepare them to face the uncertain future.

> What makes a good student?
- discipline, self-control.
- no illegal activities

> What role should the teacher have in the classroom?
Caption American:
- know exactly each pupil's personality 
- find out and help them to develop their potential ability
- teach the fundamental skills, 
 ... make sure they *know enough* for their future life 
- guide them to walk on the correct path

> How can a teacher make lessons for children more interesting?
more *participate*, interact with other classmates.
