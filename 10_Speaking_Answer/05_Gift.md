(C9-2)

> When do people give gifts or presents in your country?

In my country, people give presents on a number of different **occasions**, such as **marriage ceremonies**, **wedding anniversaries**, housewarming party, mother’s day, valentine’s day and Christmas. There are some hard-and-fast rules to gift-giving in Taiwan. For example, **under no circumstances** give a clock or a watch as a present because it **symbolises** the end of your life, and you may **cause offence**


> Do you ever take a gift when you visit someone in their home?

Yes, I do so all the time as an invited guest to someone’s house. It is **thoughtful** to bring gifts on a special occasion like a birthday, a housewarming party, or to a social visit. Last month I visited my cousin because she relocated to a semi-detached house in the **urban** area and I bought a showpiece and **a bouquet of** flowers for her.


> When did you last receive a gift?

I received a voucher last week from a local butcher shop as a VIP member. With the voucher, I can get an extra 20 percent discount when I shopping on the day of my birthday. It is not **pricey**, but the thought counts even more. I was very touched by their **thoughtfulness**.


> Do you enjoy looking for gifts for people?

No, It can be pretty tricky trying to find a perfect gift, especially if the recipient is already well-off or I am not familiar with him. I don't have time to get **clues** by guessing what they'd like based on their hobbies and **living condition**. As a result, I usually purchase a gift card as the present so that they can buy anything they like in the department store.
