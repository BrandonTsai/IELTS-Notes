Part 1
========

> How often do you make telephone calls? Why / Why not?

I make at least 5-6 phone calls every day, but the number of calls can certainly go up, depending on my activities and location. I have to make these calls as I live far away from my friends and family. Besides, I also have to make phone calls to my co-workers since my job involves a lot of travelling both inside and outside of the city where I live in.

> Who do you spend the most time talking to on the telephone? Why?

I spend most of the time talking with my family members while talking on the phone mainly because I live far away from my family in a different city, and also because I have made it a priority of my life to remain in touch with my parents and siblings under any circumstances in order to let them know that I am safe and fine.

> When do you think you’ll next make a telephone call? Why?

I will make the next phone call to my parents’ house right after finishing this IELTS test in order to let them know how I did in the test.

> Do you sometimes prefer to send a text message instead of telephoning? [Why/Why not?]

Yes, I do prefer to send text messages sometimes instead of telephoning because I am either caught among a crowd with a lot of noise around me to talk clearly or I am just too tired or busy to talk.
