Part 1

1. Are there many museums in your hometown?

Honestly, I have no clue. Museums and historical sites are places that I couldn’t care less about, so I don’t really notice if there are any in Hanoi. Maybe there’re a couple of museums somewhere, I think.

2. Do you think museums are useful for visitors to your hometown?

If they want to know more about our traditional activities and culture, sadly, no. If they find our history and the colonial wars that took place in Vietnam interesting, then yes. I think whether a place is considered ‘useful’ or ‘suitable’ for tourists depends on what they want to achieve from their visit.

3. Do you often visit a museum?

It’s like… never. For me, one should not ever go to a museum unless they are already bored to tears. Maybe I’m a little bit biased against all kinds of museums in Vietnam ever since I last visited one. I guess it’s just very boring having to walk all the way through a building just to see some pictures and odd-looking things I’m not allowed to touch.

4. Did you go to any museums when you were a child?

It was hard not to. I mean, it’s one of the ‘compulsory’ extra-curricular activities that we had back in primary school. We went to a different museum each year with the whole school, and nobody was allowed to be absent from this annual activity, even if you were sick that day.

5. Do you think museums are important?

Though I’m not really a fan of museums, it’s quite impossible to deny the importance of these places. They hold all forms of evidence of a country’s historical development, such as artefacts or documents… you name it. Besides, what makes museums very special to our society, in my opinion, is the way they teach us to have gratitude and appreciation for things that happened in our country in the past.

6. Do you think it’s suitable for museums to sell things to visitors?

Yea, why not? In fact, most museums are free of charge, so apart from the often inadequate government funding, these museums virtually have no other source of budget to cover operating and management expenses. So, revenue from selling souvenirs can act as additional income to help maintain them.

7. When was the last time you visited a museum?


 
I can’t really think of the answer for this question off the top of my head, perhaps because it’s been such a long time since the last time I went to a museum. But I don’t think I’ve ever paid a visit to any place of such a kind after primary school.

8. Are there many museums in your country?

There are! Museums in Vietnam are quite diverse, and they cover almost every field, namely the War Remnants Museum, the Fine Art Museum and plenty more. However, museums are not so appealing to the young, which is unfortunate, they could have been much more educational.

9. Do you think museums are useful for visitors?

I don’t think so I’m afraid. Museums are more like tourist attraction, because if tourists wish to search for information on a place, the Internet would be a much better option.

10. Do you often visit museum?

I don’t. I wish I do but I never have the time. My parents took me to Vietnam Museum of Ethnology every Lunar New Year festival so that I have better understanding of Vietnamese’s culture. My memories of that place are truly invaluable.

11. Did you go to any museums when you were a child?

I did, very often actually. As I said before, The Vietnam Museum of Ethology was my childhood! If my memory serves me well, it was 2007 Spring when I first visited the place. I still remember vividly how amazed I was stepping into the museum!

12. When was the last time you visited a museum?

Ever since I graduated and worked as a researcher, I’ve never had a chance to visit any museum much as I wish to. What a pity!

13. Do you think museums are important?

Absolutely! Museums are where knowledge and culture are preserved. Apparently, museums are of paramount importance and play an irreplaceable role in our educational system.

Part 3 – Two-way discussion:
Q. How often do you visit museums?
A. Although I would love to go to museums more often, I have only visited three of them until now and that would make it three times that I have been to museums!

All of them were of archaeological type but I still remember the last one- in Greece. It was the Acropolis Museum and I went there at the age of 16, during a school programme for the restitution of the Parthenon Marbles which are located in the British Museum. It is a magnificent building and it reflects the greek civilisation with the inclusion of statues, monuments and even documentaries with the purpose of informing visitors not only from overseas but also from Greece about its exhibits. I strongly believe that it was the best educational experience of my life and I would induce people to pay it a visit when possible.

Q. What type of museum is popular in your country?
A. I come from Greece so I'm going to talk about the type of museums famous there. It is widely known that Greece has a really important culture and history, so there are numerous museums throughout the country. Archaeological and Folklore museums are the most common kinds and those are visited by the majority of people. Apart from these, biographical, ethnographic and historic museums are also really rife in our country. Furthermore, there are art museums and galleries and some other that are about industry, science and technology. To conclude, there are plenty of categories that satisfy everyone's preference and desire but Archaeological and folklore museums are most popular in our country.

Q. What do you think of the importance of museums in history?
A. My personal belief is that museums are of paramount importance and constitute an integral part of a country's history. As it is known, these constructions provide information about culture and heritage; in other words, museums keep history alive. To be more precise, museums include artefacts and different objects from the past and by placing them there, people are reassured that the items they see provide clear and accurate information about the history, rather than reading books and magazines in which most of the details are subjective and theoretical. In addition, if I'm allowed to speak in economic terms, I would say that museums are history's brands and trademarks.

Q. How do you think of the heritage of a country?
A. It seems to me that the heritage of a nation isn't determined by only one thing. To begin, monuments, sculptures and temples are essential and they are representative examples as far as heritage is concerned. For example, the Parthenon in Greece, Statue of Liberty in the USA, Hatshepsut's Mortuary Temple and Pyramids in Egypt, Tower of London in the UK are only some the most significant structures that reflect each country's legacy. History composes an important part as well, by informing people about the achievements and failures of a territory and the reason why something is known and studied by many. Lastly, museums which we were talking about earlier couldn't be missing from this list, not only for all the important aspects they have but also because they are connected with the beauty and grandeur of a country.

Q. Compare museums nowadays and in the past.
A. Anyone who pays a visit to museums could say that nowadays museums are more beautiful, modern, have a rich collection, and convenient to visit than in the past. To elucidate, in the past, only a few people had access to them but these days they are open spaces for public knowledge. Furthermore, much attention is given to the maintenance of the museums now than the past and most of the museums are renovated not only for their preservation but also to attract more public interest. In addition, technological advances have played a fundamental role; with videos and audios helping visitors understand what they see and that makes their experience more pleasant, informative and interactive than the past when these technological usages were absent.

Q. Have you ever been to a foreign museum?
A. The truth is I have never been to a museum outside my country, but I would really like to go someday. The first museum that comes to my mind is the British Museum in the UK and despite the fact that I have been living in England for the last three years, I never managed to visit this renowned institution. Some other museums that I definitely want to visit are the Metropolitan Museum of Art and National Portrait Gallery in the USA and the National Museum of Ireland.

Q: What are the tourist attractions in your city?
A. I live in Hatfield which is 30 km north of London and there are many things tourists can see and do there. Firstly, it is really worth seeing Hatfield House which is on the eastern side of the town. Secondly, Mill Green Museum and watermill, Hatfield Park Farm and Hatfield Public Library are places that someone should visit without a doubt. Finally, the University of Hertfordshire and The Galleria Outlet Shopping are some good and interesting structures for everyone.

[Tips: Think about your city's attractions and try to tell a few things about them. For example, you can talk about libraries, universities, monuments, museums, temples or even some locations that are preferred by many when they visit your city.]
