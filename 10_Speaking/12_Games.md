Questions
=========

### Part 1:

> What games are popular in your country?
Back to my childhood, Hide And See was the most popular game for children. We usually played Hide And See in the community centre after school or in the weekend. However, I think young people in current society are more interested in online games or video games. Although most parents know some video games with simulated violence may influence a player's thoughts, feelings and physical arousal, video games are still more and more popular in my country. Some parents also play video games together with their children.

> Do you play any games?

Yes, some of my favourites are Poker and board games because I used to play them with friends a lot.
There were many different board games we can borrow from the local library, we also had a board game club in my previous company. I like the interaction and the competition of it - it's more interesting than watching TV alone and you do not need to worry about the weather because it is an indoor activity.

> How do people learn to play games in your country.

Games were quite simple a few decades ago. For example, when I studied in elementary school, my classmate and I like to play marbles in the ground. The rule is pretty simple, you just need to hit the marbles via your finger and the marbles that is closest to the hole is the winner.
for those complicate puzzle games, we usually learn it from the guidebook.
One huge different in modern times is that we how have thousands of complicate video games to choose from. it is pretty to find the breakthroughs from the internet for players.

> Do you think it is important for people to play games.

Playing games is very important not only because they can relieve stress, but also
learn about good sportsmanship. Besides, games can bring many benefits to children.
For example, hide and see can improve hand-eye coordination through physical sports.
Playing house can exercise their imaginations and puzzle games can help develop brain and mental health.
