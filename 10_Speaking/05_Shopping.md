Part 3
=======

> Do people in your country enjoy going to open-air markets that sell things like food or clothes or old objects? Which type of market is more popular? Why?

Yes, people in my country do enjoy going to open-air markets that sell various food, clothing items and old objects. In fact, most Indian markets traditionally are open-air street markets, apart from the “supermarkets” and “city markets” in some kind of building structures in the cities. These traditional markets are very popular among the Indians for centuries. These open-air markets enjoy huge popularity among Indians mainly because all commodities sold there are mostly very affordable. Besides, food and vegetables at these marketplaces are popular also because of their freshness.

> Do you think markets are more suitable places for selling certain types of things? Why do you think this is?

Yes, traditionally, markets are more suitable places for selling, not just certain types of things but all kinds of things, mainly because of the conveniences and benefits they provide. In fact, it is not realistic to expect that the buyers will visit from places to places for hours and days in order to find and buy what they need. Selling everything at markets also ensures that both the sellers and buyers are getting the “fair” market prices of their products and commodities since there are always some rooms for “bargaining”. Besides, when it comes to monitoring and regulations, it is much easier to monitor and regulate markets by the government authorities for all kinds of smooth transactions, monetary or otherwise.

> Do you think young people feel the same about shopping at markets as older people? Why is that?

I don’t really think that young people feel the same about shopping at markets as older people mainly because it is not that convenient to shop in a market. At markets, one has to go from one place to another to buy certain things, which is time-consuming and frustrating affair at times, while young people usually prefer to hang out with friends at one place and have fun these days. While older people would rather prefer to save some money, because of their traditional beliefs and lifestyles, by buying things at markets, young people these days may not actually be that enthusiastic about saving money in this way.

> What do you think are the advantages of buying things from shops rather than markets?

One of the greatest advantages of buying things from a shop, rather than markets, is that buying at shops is much less time consuming since many/all commodities can be purchased pretty much from the same shop. Besides, buying things at shops are much more convenient since one doesn’t really have to struggle with the heat of the sun, cold or rain in the open as opposed to purchasing things at markets. Finally, it is better to buy things from shops because some of those things actually remain well-preserved and healthy most of the times which may not be the case when buying things from markets.

> How does advertising influence what people choose to buy? Is this true for everyone?

Advertisers spend tons of money by presenting things in a very colourful and tempting manner on different media outlets in order to influence people in their purchasing habits. For example, when a particular clothing company “dresses” up a very famous and beautiful actress or model and make her look really happy in that dress, made by the company, on television or magazines, the chances are that some young women out there in the market would also want to look the same by purchasing that particular dress because it is our human psychology to identify ourselves with somebody “famous and beautiful”. But, does this human psychology apply to everyone? The answer is “no” since we all are different with different kinds of taste, preference and judgment.

> Do you think that any recent changes in the way people live have affected general shopping habits? Why is this?

Yes, I do think that recent changes, in the way people live, have considerably affected general shopping habits. In fact, our expectations have increased in many folds since, in these days, we prefer more convenience, comfort and luxury than our “conventional, moderate and economic lifestyles” can offer. For example, we are not really happy and satisfied with a “regular” affordable clothing item, made by some unknown local company, rather we look for some expensive clothing items made by some famous international brands because we most probably want to feel more “valuable” and stylish than the “average”. Besides, we have too many choices and we have created a throwaway society with our consumerism habits.
