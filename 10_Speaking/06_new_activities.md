Part 1
======

> Do you like to try new activities?

Yes, I do. I am an adventurous person. Trying some new activities is really exciting and motivating as it tests my courage and ``expands my horizons``. It always teaches me that I am capable of more. Besides, facing new challenges is ``acquiring`` life lessons that will surely be very helpful for my personal growth.


> Is it good for people to try new things?

Yes, it teaches people ``humility`` and helps them to ``expands the perspective on life``. When I try to learn somethings new, such as skiing and chess, I’m reminded to be humble and to appreciate every small milestone because I know there are no shortcuts to become an expert at something. I focus on getting over any of my fears of looking ``silly``. Being a beginner doesn’t mean you are any less ``fabulous``. It’s okay not to be the expert for once.

> Why are some people afraid of trying new things?

some people prefer to stay in the comfort zone not only because the fear of the 'unknow' but also they are afraid of making mistakes. The uncertain and unforeseeable situation might freak them out and make them feel embarrassed and ``inadequate``.


> Do you think it's better to have new experiences when you're young or when you're older?

In my perspective, people should try new things as young as possible so that they can discover their interest and take control of their life experiences. Dedicating some time to step out of the comfort zone allows people to touch base with themselves about who they are and what they like to do. Once they find out one thing they really love to do, they can invest the rest of life on this activity and try to have ``a sense of achievement``.


> Did you try new activities when you were younger?
 
Both are fine for me because each experience is completely different. I mean, if I do things on my own, I’ll be able to understand my capacity to do things and get things done. If I try new activities with my buddies, I’ll be able to learn the value of teamwork and normally it’s more fun.


Part 2
======

> Describe something you did that was new or exciting.
> You should say:
>
> - what you did
> - where and when you did this
> - who you shared the activity with
>
> and explain why this activity was new or exciting for you.

“Cricket” isn’t exactly a popular sport in China, at least not popular in the part of China where I live. So, about a few months ago, when my Indian friend and co-worker asked me to join them in a friendly cricket match, I was a bit skeptical, to say the least, not because I didn’t enjoy the game, but because I thought that the game was a bit too difficult for me to learn. Nevertheless, I agreed to join since my Indian friend promised to “train” me well before the start of the match.

So, my training started at a local football park since we didn’t exactly have any “cricket field” in China. By the way, my friend had asked me earlier, before the training started, if I would prefer throwing a “ball” to someone or hitting a ball out of the park with a bat. Without thinking much, I said that I would rather like to hit the ball out of the park! So, my friend declared me as a “batsman”. Anyway, my friend tried his best to teach me how to “hit” ball with my “bat”, and once the training was over, I was told by my Indian friend that I would play in his “team” as a batsman.

Anyway, being a part of a cricket team was really a new experience for me primarily because I never really played that sport before. It was also exciting for me because, in the process of learning the game, I actually did manage to hit a few balls out of the park by hitting them with my bats which, I thought, wasn’t possible! Besides, I also realized that “cricket” was not only about “hitting” the balls as hard as one could, but one also would need to make a lot of smart calculations and “moves” before trying to hit the ball in order to avoid getting caught or “out” by the opponent team. It was also exciting for me because I finally realized “cricket” wasn’t really a very difficult sport to learn and play!

 

Part 3
=======

> Why do you think some people like doing new things?

Some people would say it’s part of human nature. If we had never tried new things we would never have made any progress throughout history.
Personally, I think some people prefer ``facing new challenge`` rather than ``follow the routine``.
You get to see new places, meet new people and learn something, and if it’s something difficult maybe you have ``a sense of achievement`` at the end.
Maybe we don’t always enjoy doing new things, but it’s always good to try something you haven’t done before.
I think many people are curious - that’s why they do it.

> What problems can people have when they try new activities for the first time?

When people try new activities for the first time, a major problem they face is that they become nervous simply because it is our human nature to ``fear the “unknown”``. The next problem they probably face is that they get ``“discouraged”`` by their so-called well-wishers not to try out anything new. But, even if we “cross” this first hurdle, the next thing we worry about is whether we will able to do them properly or not - just the way they are supposed to be done. But, then, when we finally do try the new activities after crossing all the hurdles, the chances are we will fail. And once we fail, we will probably give up trying new activities, which is, of course, a worst-case scenario.

> Do you think it’s best to do new things on your own or with other people? Why?

Well, it depends on what we are trying. But, I think that it is best to do new things with other people mainly because they will probably be able to guide us ``from the very start`` to ensure our success. But, in case we fail, we won’t probably feel so bad and ``embarrassed`` since there is a chance that somebody else also has failed. Besides, trying new things together with other people won’t make us feel as nervous as we would have tried it alone, in case if we need help.


> What kinds of things do children learn to do when they are very young? How important are these things?

As very young children, the first things, they learn are ‘smell’ and ‘taste’, followed by recognizing “speech” and ‘faces’ as growing up further. By the time a ``toddler`` is two, his or her language skills are at “peak” and start to pick up “bits and pieces” of conversations from their fathers, mothers and ``siblings``. By the age of 5, children start to learn reading, throwing/catching a ball, drawing images and writing their names neatly. By the age of 7, they learn how to ride a bicycle as well as learn how to become “competitive”.

Whatever the children learn, when they are very young, prove out to be very important for their proper ``cognitive`` development which is remembering, problem-solving, and decision-making, from childhood through ``adolescence`` to ``adulthood``.

> Do you think children and adults learn to do new things in the same way? How is their learning style different?

There are fundamental differences between the way in which children and adults learn. Children depend on adults to learn something while adults usually learn through a self-learning process without necessarily depending on others. While children usually are motivated by the idea of rewards and punishments to learn something, adults learn something mostly out of ``“curiosit”``.

Besides, while children, in principle, are opened to the idea of learning pretty much anything, adults mostly choose to learn what, they think, is “relevant” to their lives. Finally, while children treat “learning” as their first job and priority, the adults think of learning as a “secondary” thing to their careers and families in general.

> Some people say that it is more important to be able to learn new things now than it was in the past. Do you agree or disagree with that? Why?

I do agree with it when somebody says that it is more important to learn new things these days than it was in the past mainly because life, in general, has become much more difficult and competitive in the modern era than in the past. For example, in the past, it was enough to have a simple graduation degree in any subject and get a respectable job, but now even a doctoral degree in a very demanding subject isn’t enough to get even a very simple job in some cases. Besides, these days, we demand more from our lives, as opposed to what we demanded in the past, which forces us to come up with new ideas and opportunities to make our life more comfortable. And, without learning new things, it is just not possible to create new opportunities for our as well as others lives.
