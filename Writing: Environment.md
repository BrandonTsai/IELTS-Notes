Deforestation
-----------------

General Facts:
- Scientists have claimed that only 10 per cent of the rainforests may be left by 2030. 
- The general public are frequently **confronted** with **statements** about the alarming rate of loss of **tropical rainforests**.

Causes:
- A great number of trees **were felled** to build cities or clear land for agricultural use
- Trees have been cut down for wood or as the source of papers.

Problem/Consequences
- Greenhouse gases
	- There are fewer trees to produce **oxygen** and **absorb** **carbon dioxide**. 
- Endangered species
	- **species** are at risk of being made **extinct** 
	- lose their habitat. 
	- Ecosystems die out.


Solutions:
- stop cutting down trees to preserve the remaining forests
	- stop using Palm Oil and paper.
	- creating national parks to conservation of biodiversity
- tree restoration
	- The study found that mass tree planting would be the most effective and cheapest way.


Endangered species / Wildlife Protection
------------------------

<iframe src="https://quizlet.com/507710903/flashcards/embed?i=7u4xy&x=1jj1" height="500" width="100%" style="border:0"></iframe>

General Facts
- One million animal and plant species are at risk of becoming extinct because humans won’t put saving the Earth ahead of making money 
- Numerous studies claims that one out of every ten plant and animal species is expected to become extinct by 2050.


Causes:

- Deforestation: 
	- Lost habitats mean losing the species that live there.
- global warming
	- With the rising temperatures of the Arctic, sea ice melts, which eliminates the habitat of polar bears and various other animals. 
- Hunt illegally
	-  Many species of plants and animals have become extinct due to human activity.
    -  Wild animals are being poached on a massive scale, with millions of individual animals worldwide killed or captured illegally.
    
Problems/Consequences
- Loss of Biodiversity
	- The levels of biodiversity across the world have significantly decreased
	- The loss of natuel medicines: Twenty-five percent of medicines are **derived** from the nature environment.
- Endangering the balance of food chain
	- Many endangered species are top **predators**, 
	- Without these predators to keep other animals' numbers in check, **prey** populations grew larger.
	- ex. wolves -> rabbits & rats -> farming and agriculture.

Solution:
-   Focus on wildlife conservation – protect wildlife habitats by controlling pollution and creating nature reserves
-   Stop deforestation
-   Limit green gas emissions
-   Support organizations dedicated to fighting species extinction



Land Degradation and Desertification / Soild Pollution
-----------------------------------------

<iframe src="https://quizlet.com/507591458/flashcards/embed?i=7u4xy&x=1jj1" height="500" width="100%" style="border:0"></iframe>

Causes
- deforestation
- industrial farming with agrochemical

Problems/Consequences
- land degradation can result in the desertification or abandonment of land (or both).
- serious knock-on effects for humans, such as malnutrition, disease, forced migration, cultural damage, and even war.

Solutions
- Bring back the trees 
	- Without plant and tree cover, **erosion** happens much more easily. 
	- **Sustainable** forest management efforts and **reforestation** schemes are key. 
- Curb industrial farming and over-grazing
	- Responsible **regulation** of land and agriculture 
	- Less dairy, and much more fruit and veg.

Waste disposal
-------------------
Waste disposal poses a threat to not only the Earth and its environment but humans as well.

a landfill - an area of land where large amounts of waste are buried under the earth

factories that empty toxic waste into rivers and oceans The dumping of toxic waste has contaminated the area.

Plastic Pollution
---------------------

Most plastics do not biodegrade which means no natural process can break them down.

Plastics are littering cities, oceans, and waterways, contributing to health problems in humans and animals.

Plastic is often dumped in the ocean where it is consumed by wildlife. Solutions:

-    Recycle plastic
    
-    Use biodegradable packaging in supermarkets
    
-    Limit the production of single-use plastic


Water Pollution
-------------------------

Causes
- The amount of industrial and domestic sewage results in the destruction of water resources.
	- many industries do not have a proper waste management system and drain the waste in the fresh water which goes into rivers, canals, later into the sea.
- Contaminants such as chemicals, nutrients, and heavy metals are carried from farms by streams and rivers into our bays and estuaries.

Consequence
- More and more people in the world lack access to clean water.
	- 600 million people in the world do not have access to clean water.
- Sewage affect people’s health
	- Over 80% of the disease in developing countries is related to poor drinking water and sanitation.

Solution
- Capture and filter sediment laden water in waterways.
- **organic farming** can be used to reduce water pollution in waterways.
	- Reduced Exposure to Pesticides and Chemicals
